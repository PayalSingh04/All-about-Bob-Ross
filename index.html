    <h1>All about Bob Ross</h1>
 <p>Bob Ross was an American painter and art instructor that hosted his abilities on television, encouraging others to bring out the inner artist in them. His television show called "The Joy of Painting" was created and hosted by him and most of his oil paintings were donated to charities or PBS stations. At the age of 18, Ross enlisted in the Army. While he was serving our country, he discovered oil paintings and studied the "Wet on wet" technique,allowing him to complete paintings in under an hour. With this technique, he used it on his show instructing others to create beautiful paintings with encouraging words like "believe that you can do it, because you can do it".<br><br>
 Later on in his career, he made more tutorials, how-to-books, art supplies, and had other instructors to help continue his line of work. Till today, he still makes profit off of them. His kind nature and sense of calm made the viewers feel like they were painting in a one-on-one lesson. On July 4th 1995, Bob Ross died from Lymphoma. His legacy still lives on, with his fan base on twitter of more than 67,000 followers.</p>
